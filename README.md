# Discord Avalon

Bot to run a game of  _The Resistance: Avalon_ in Discord

# Usage

This bot works through a **DM** system, where you initiate a game of Avalon by using the command `!avalon`.

This will generate a random 4-letter game ID that you can send to your friends, which they can use to enter the game with `!join <game_id>`.

Players can DM the bot a list of commands, and important information will be DMed to all players.

I will try to work on a channel system, but it will most likely have a rougher game flow.
